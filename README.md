# Chelmerrox Photography web page

## Description

 This is my own project - building a web page for all of my photographs. HTML5 and CSS3 were used to build the web page, however, there isn't any JavaScript code used in this.

 This project is solely for practising on placements and styling of a web page and creating a web page (and perhaps, eventually a web site) for all of my own photographs and art.
